# Starter for Vue+Go+Postgres+Docker

This is a starter project for a Vue+Go+Postgres+Docker setup.

## Setup

Install `docker-compose` (and probably `docker` too), then type the following on the root folder:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

## TODO 

- [x] Create something that deploys
- [ ] Add frontend service to docker-compose
- [ ] Integrate backend with the postgres database
- [ ] Integrate frontend with backend
- [ ] Allow code watching for auto-reload when saving new code instead of always typing in `docker-compose up`
